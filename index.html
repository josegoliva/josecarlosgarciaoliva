		José García Oliva is a Venezuelan artist based in London. 
		His work explores the clash between diasporic identity, migrant labour, 
		and cultural heritage. These collisions are explored through materials, everyday objects,
		and performative actions that emerge with each research project. Oliva's multidisciplinary 
		practice is driven by collaborative processes and aims to react to and expose sociopolitical 
		oppression through participatory performances or public interventions. The result of his work 
		is often the enactment of these social exchanges and provocations shaped by the commons and site 
		specificity. Oliva graduated from the Royal College of Art, London, in 2020 and completed her Bachelor 
		of Fine Arts in Madrid with a mobility grant from the Ministry of Education. Oliva currently leads the 
		Visual Communication postgraduate course at Ravensbourne University and is an associate tutor in the Visual
		Design postgraduate course at Kingston School of Art.
